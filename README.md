# UX
<p>
My goal is to creat a user-friendly interative Data-Centric Development project. I want to keep my overall website
white and black as the actualy product has splashes of colour and I think the white background couples
up with the clean product that Clay Cosmetics is promoting.

# Design

<p>When designing this website I looked at other beauty or fashion websites to get an understanding of their approaches of design.
I took into consideration of how I felt when visiting a page and what I liked to see on a website. I found a lot of beauty and fashion 
websites are minimal with little colour. They will often use white as their background colour which I personally prefer as a user.
</p>

## Colour

<p> I chose to use white as the main colour for my design. I found that using white refected my 'minimal' and 'sustainable' brand.
I created the logo myself which gave me the freedom to spefically choose the colour style and theme throughout the website. The branding colours 
has a rich Orange with complimenting calmer tones such as the light Pink and Green. This combination creates a harmony that can add with each
page, so the website has flashes of colour that is subtle but not too overloaded.
</p>

## logo

<p> I created the main logo based on two letter 'C's' that stand for 'Clay Cosmetics' I wanted have a logo that had a reflection of the name of 
the brand. Circular symbols also denote togethernes and harmony, so by making this logo a cirlce it also gave the website a calm feel. This is something
very important through this site. As the whole brand represents being good to one's self and being to the planet.

<p> The hand is a representation of clay. I wanted to combine the making of clay to the logo and the product.
As the product has all natural ingredientds such as clay being natural and from the earth, so instead of having an image
of actual clay, I wanted a more subtle connotation.

## Font

<p> I used two main for throughout my site. For my Title I used a font called 'Shippori+Mincho' which is a serif font.
I really like serif fonts for luxurious websites, I think it gives a more expensive feel and more editorial. I like how they use 
serif fonts in Vogue magazine which is matched with a sans serif font. In this case I used Montserrat as I am aware after some research that
Montserrat font is a strong, clear web font to use.I think it is important to not go too over board with body text as the user needs to be able to read and understand what they are reading.
I finally then added some 'script' font called Homemade+Apple, I feel that this just added a homemade, hands effect to the site and brand.

### Homepage

<p> For the home page, I wanted to keep it really minimal and for th user to be introduced with the logo
and get a feel about the simplicity of how the page will flow.
</p>

### About

<p>The about page has information about the brand, it is the second page of the website and it is an introduction
for the the user about brnad what the brand represents, the values of the compnay and a section to 'meet the team' 
This give a more personal touch for the user to make them feel more connect with the people who work at Clay Cosmetics.
</p>

<p> The page talks about how their product is a sustainable commodity and to inform the user what Clay 
Cosmetics is doing to ensure that their product is sustainable for the planet and is a friendly product to use on your skin
without any nasty chemcials
