Clay Cosmetics

This website is about a natural vegan friendly product called - Clay Cosmetics.
This product provides a range of beauty products the vary from skin care to make-up.
The purpose of this website is to sell the products from the company Clay Cosmetics and to provide 
infomation behind the story of the company and its values. The company not only wants to sell, but wants
to show their customer what they are doing in the beauty world to be sustainable and cruelty free.
The user is able to contact the company and send a message if they have any questions about the product and 
is able to see where the company is located with the map provided.


UX
My goal is to creat a user-friendly interative Data-Centric Development project. I want to keep my overall website
white and black as the actualy product has splashes of colour and I think the white background couples
up with the clean product that Clay Cosmetics is promoting.
